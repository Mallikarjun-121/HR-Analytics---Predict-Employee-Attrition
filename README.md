🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

SHAP: Model interpretability & explainability

Power BI: Dashboard and stakeholder-facing visualizations

Google Colab: Analysis and model development

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key insights uncovered:

High attrition in Sales and R&D departments

Younger employees (age 25–35) and low salary bands showed higher attrition

Employees with frequent OverTime and BusinessTravel were more likely to resign

Attrition rate is highest among employees with 0–3 years at the company

Visuals used:

Correlation matrix

Boxplots

Bar charts for trend identification

🤖 Machine Learning Models
Two classification models were trained:

Logistic Regression (Baseline)

Decision Tree Classifier (max_depth=5)

Metric	Logistic Regression	Decision Tree
Accuracy	~87%	~84%
ROC AUC Score	~0.80	~0.66

🔍 SHAP Explainability
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to explain feature contributions.
