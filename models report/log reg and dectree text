Summary:

Both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models achieved perfect performance on the test set. They both correctly classified all instances, with 100% precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The confusion matrices show no misclassifications, and the ROC AUC score is 1.0 for both models. These results may indicate a highly separable dataset or potential overfitting, and further validation is recommended.
